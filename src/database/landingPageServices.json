Given that the temperature inside the car lodge can ascend to 60°C, determining the status of your vehicle AC ought to be your first concern. There can be a large group of issues creeping up like low cooling, smell, failed compressor, and many more. That's why regular AC maintenance is necessary to keep the cooling at maximum efficiency. Do you want to know how Car AC works? Car Automotive Air Conditioning Service Explained In this blog, we are describing how Car AC works and what goes inside AC servicing. You can also learn more about vital AC components, common AC issues and how you can maintain your Car AC at home. Components of Car AC Compressor Only the Compressor is responsible for pressing the refrigerant gas, which is known as Freon. We can also say the compressor works like a pump. After the compression of gas, it becomes hot and transmitted through a condenser. Compressor plays a vital role in the working of Car AC. Refrigerant Refrigerant is also one of the important components of Car AC. It is basically a fluid contained within the coils of a car AC system. Before 1993, R-12 a.k.a Freon refrigerant is used. Later, it replaces with Freon because it harmed the environment. Condenser A condenser is a series of coils. It helps to remove the heat from the compressed gas. The condenser acts as a heat exchanger and helps to cool the refrigerant by changing the state from gas to liquid form. Evaporator The evaporator is another crucial component of Car AC. If you need cold and refresh air, it plays an important role. Usually, it is located inside the car. But sometimes you can also find an evaporator just right behind the dashboard. Thermal Expansion Valve The thermal expansion valve works in tandem with the evaporator. It helps to controls the pressure of the AC refrigerant. Thermal Expansion Valve or Orifice Tube monitors the quantity of pressure and temperature of the Car A/C system. Dryer/Accumulator It contains a desiccant and responsible for pulling away moisture. 9+ Top Reasons that your Car AC isn’t cooling Enough Car AC Service Fully Explained Are you looking for car ac servicing? When you take your car for a car air conditioning repair, the mechanic starts by checking the cabin temperature. The temperature should be approximately 5°C-10°C. After checking this, the technician then proceeds to check the level of the refrigerant present in the system. In case if the refrigerant level drops it highly affects the AC’s ability to cool. It is one of the common reasons why your car AC isn’t working properly. By using a pressure gauge and a precision AC gas recharging machine, they flush the refrigerant out and best it up to the suggested level. While working on this, car mechanic also check leakage or cracks in the AC line and hoses.. If there is an apparent leak it could be because of a bad seal and bearing. Then the compressor starts making a buzzing noise. One of the best ways to keep a compressor working well is to be checked regulary and serviced. Also, you can replace the compressor oil for the maintenance of the compressor. After that technician comes the compressor, which is the most valuable component in a car AC system. In case if the the compressor malfunctions, the whole AC system will fail. The condenser, which lives before the motor is checked for twisted/harmed balances or an obstructed line. A condenser becomes stopped up because of leaves, residue and flotsam and jetsam develop. It can likewise truly cut down the cooling productivity of the AC. In case such is the situation, the condenser is washed with gentle water pressure to not twist the balances. Besides, they likewise check whether the dryer is appropriately working. They likewise do a last investigation of the evaporator for any dampness develop. The dampness develop isn't uplifting news. This is on the grounds that the water content can saturate indispensable electrical segments under the dashboard. At long last, they clean the lodge channel or the HVAC channel (warming, ventilation, cooling) situated under the glove box. After each 15,000km, the channel is supplanted. 5 Common Car AC Problems Car AC not cooling enough This can be because of a low refrigerant level or a failed compressor, which can be very costly to fix. Another reason for this is, something as simple as a stopped-up condenser. If the condenser becomes clogged it minimizes the surface area of the coil and this outcome in less cooling. Bad odor from the AC A weak or solid foul smell would highlight shape/buildup or moisture formation in the AC filter. Cleaning or supplanting the filter generally takes care of the issue. Yet, on the off chance that you smell spoiled eggs while working the AC, We stringently suggest you ought to get a professional technician to handle this. Loud whirring noise Loud high-pitched buzzing noise while operating the AC can be due to a shot compressor bearing. In case, if the sound is coming from inside the cabin, the blower fan assembly should be repaired or replaced. Water seeping inside the cabin If you notice water inside the car cabin, this is because of outside becomes blocked. Engine overheating Actually like the steering or the water pump, the compressor utilizes some power from the engine. The clutch on the compressor can hold onto making the compressor put a superfluous burden. This in the long run overheats the engine. If you are looking to repair car air conditioning at home, here are a few steps: Wipe the vents Dust on the car AC vent can eventually accumulate. You need to clean it. You can remove the dust by using a brush or a sponge. Gently clean the AC vent every once in a while otherwise it causes a drop in cooling. Clean the cabin filter You need to clean the dirty cabin filter or the HVAC filter regularly. This filter is located just behind the glove box. It can lead to foul odor while the AC operates. You can easily clean the filter with a brush. Clean the condenser As we already discussed, the condenser is located behind the front bumper of the car. You can clean it with a high-pressure jet washer and chemical chemicals. If you're a responsible car owner, make sure to service your car AC regularly to maintain cooling efficiency.

      "title": "Why is Choosing the Best Quality Car Tyre one of the most Important aspects?",
      "subtitle": "3 Min read",
      "content": " Tyres are incredibly complex products. All the tyres that you see stocked up in a tyre store can look all good. But, just because they look alike does not mean they do the same job. There could be a big difference in the design of these tyres. At the first glance, the tread pattern of every new tyre might look convincing. Unfortunately, what you don’t see is what that construction is made from, what is underneath the tread pattern, the compounds and the ingredients that have been used . That’s where a premium manufacturer spends millions every year to develop a tyre that’s perfect for wet, dry, hot and cold conditions. This ensures your tyre will do exactly what it is supposed to do in all driving conditions. While that is not the case with a low quality tyre. It might be ok in dry conditions but might not be completely ok in wet conditions. This is also explains the low cost of such tyres. In a country like India where we experience almost 3 to 4 months of rain every year, the design of the tyre tread is not just about styling. It plays a crucial role in keeping your car under control in wet conditions. If your tyres don’t cut through the surface of water effectively your car will end up hydroplaning. Which means your tyres will surf on top of the water and you will no longer be connected to the road and will be unable to stop or steer. Hence, especially when it comes to wet driving, the right quality tyres can make all the difference. Factors that give premium high quality tyres an edge over the rest are: Superior Braking – Branded tyres made of premium rubber generate a lot of grip and are well connected to the surface of the road. As a result, the stopping distance is much less. Cornering Performance – A big difference is experienced during cornering. Low quality tyres don’t produce enough grip and skid off the corner. This is because their ability to stick to the road is far less as compared to premium tyres. Higher grade rubber. Better handling and overall driving performance. Increased life span - The high quality rubber compounds and other polymers along with the cutting-edge engineering technology used in manufacturing the tyre results into longer life of the tyres. So, choose your tyres wisely. Top tyre manufacturer like Michelin uses the latest technology, making it the brand of choice for long lasting, reliable tyres in India. If you are concerned about the performance of your tyres then why not check out some best quality tyres and seek advice from one of the professional tyre dealers near you.  ",
